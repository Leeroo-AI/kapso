description: "A framework for autonomous program discovery and optimization"
---

Tinkerer combines **iterative experimentation** with a **knowledge base** of best practices and tricks to discover code improvements. 

It automates the cycle of **designing**, **testing**, and **refining** algorithms,  eventually adapting the optimized solution for **deployment** on your chosen infrastructure.

## How It Works

</Frame>

- **`.research()`** — Run deep web research to gather ideas and implementation references. Returns structured findings you can feed into the knowledge base or use as context for evolving solutions.

- **`.learn()`** — Ingest knowledge from repositories, past solutions, or research results. Extracts patterns and best practices into the Knowledge Graph.

- **`.evolve()`** — Run iterative experiments to build software for a goal. Uses tree search, coding agents, and KG context to generate and refine solutions.

- **`.deploy()`** — Turn a solution into running software. Supports local execution, Docker containers, or cloud platforms like Modal.

## Core Components

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **OrchestratorAgent** | Coordinates the solve loop, manages budget (time, cost, iterations) |
| **Search Strategy** | Tree search for solution exploration (expand, select, prune) |
| **Experiment Workspace** | Git-based workspace with branch per experiment |
| **Coding Agents** | Pluggable code generators (Aider, Gemini, Claude Code, OpenHands) |
| **Knowledge Search** | Neo4j-based domain knowledge retrieval |
