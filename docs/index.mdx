## What is Kapso?

Kapso combines **iterative experimentation** with a **knowledge base** of best practices, domain knowledge, and implementation patterns to discover and validate code improvements. 

It automates the cycle of **designing**, **running**, **evaluating**, and **refining** solutions,  eventually adapting the optimized solution for **deployment** on your chosen infrastructure.

## Core Workflow

```python
from src.kapso import Kapso, Source, DeployStrategy

# Initialize Kapso with a pre-indexed Knowledge Graph
kapso = Kapso(kg_index="data/indexes/kaggle.index")

# Research: Gather ideas from the web
research_findings  = kapso.research(
    "XGBoost best practices for tabular datasets",
    depth="deep",
)

# Learn: Ingest knowledge from repositories
kapso.learn(
    sources=[
        Source.Repo("https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn"),
        *research_findings.repos(top_k=10),
    ],
    wiki_dir="data/wikis",
)

# Evolve: Build a solution through experimentation
solution = kapso.evolve(
    goal="XGBoost classifier for Titanic dataset with AUC > 0.85",
    output_path="./models/titanic_v1",
    evaluator="regex_pattern",
    evaluator_params={"pattern": r"AUC: ([\d.]+)"},
    stop_condition="threshold",
    stop_condition_params={"threshold": 0.85},
    context=[
        research_findings.ideas(top_k=20),
        research_findings.papers(top_k=10),
    ],
)

# Deploy: Turn solution into running software
software = kapso.deploy(solution, strategy=DeployStrategy.LOCAL)
result = software.run({"data_path": "./test.csv"})
```

## The Four Pillars

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Evolve" icon="dna">
    **`.evolve()`** : Run iterative evaluation grounded experiments to build the optimum solution for a goal. Uses tree search, coding agents, and KG context to generate ideas and refine solutions.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Learn" icon="brain">
    **`.learn()`** : Ingest knowledge from repositories, past solutions, or written knowledge. Extracts patterns and best practices into the Knowledge Graph.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Research" icon="magnifying-glass">
    **`.research()`** : Run deep web research to gather ideas, implementation references and releveant repositories. Returns structured findings you can pass to learning or use as context for evolving solutions.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Deploy" icon="rocket">
    **`.deploy()`** :  Turn a solution into running app. Supports local execution, Docker containers, or cloud platforms like Modal.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Core Components

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Kapso** | Main API class — orchestrates research, learn, evolve, and deploy |
| **OrchestratorAgent** | Runs the experimentation loop with budget tracking and stopping conditions |
| **Search Strategy** | Explores solutions via tree search or linear search |
| **Coding Agents** | Pluggable code generators: Aider, Gemini, Claude Code, OpenHands |
| **Knowledge Pipeline** | Two-stage learning: Ingestors extract WikiPages → Merger integrates into KG |
| **Knowledge Search** | Hybrid retrieval using Weaviate (semantic) + Neo4j (graph structure) |
| **Evaluators** | Score solutions: regex patterns, JSON files, LLM judges |
| **Stop Conditions** | Control when to stop: threshold, plateau, cost/time limits |
| **Deployment** | Turn solutions into running software: Local, Docker, Modal, BentoML |

## Supported Benchmarks

## Why Kapso?

- **Knowledge-Grounded**: Solutions are informed by domain knowledge, not just LLM priors
- **Iterative Refinement**: Tree search explores multiple approaches, learns from failures
- **Pluggable Components**: Swap coding agents, evaluators, and search strategies
- **Full Lifecycle**: From research to deployment in a single framework
