description: "A knowledge-grounded framework for autonomous program synthesis and optimization"
---

Tinkerer combines **iterative experimentation** with a **knowledge base** of best practices and tricks to discover code improvements. 

It automates the cycle of **designing**, **testing**, and **refining** algorithms,  eventually adapting the optimized solution for **deployment** on your chosen infrastructure.

## How It Works

</Frame>

- **`.research()`** — Run deep web research to gather ideas and implementation references. Returns structured findings you can feed into the knowledge base or use as context for evolving solutions.

- **`.learn()`** — Ingest knowledge from repositories, past solutions, or research results. Extracts patterns and best practices into the Knowledge Graph.

- **`.evolve()`** — Run iterative experiments to build software for a goal. Uses tree search, coding agents, and KG context to generate and refine solutions.

- **`.deploy()`** — Turn a solution into running software. Supports local execution, Docker containers, or cloud platforms like Modal.

## Core Components

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **OrchestratorAgent** | Runs the main experimentation loop. Stops when score threshold is reached, budget is exhausted, or LLM decides the task is complete. |
| **Search Strategy** | Explores solutions via tree search — expands promising nodes, selects best candidates, and prunes underperformers. Runs experiments in parallel. |
| **Experiment Workspace** | Git-based isolation for experiments. Each experiment runs on its own branch, enabling tree-based exploration and easy rollback. |
| **Coding Agents** | Pluggable code generators: Aider (diff-based editing), Gemini, Claude Code, OpenHands. Agents generate code; git is handled separately. |
| **Knowledge Pipeline** | Two-stage learning: (1) Ingestors extract WikiPages from repos, solutions, or research; (2) Merger intelligently creates or merges pages into the KG. |
| **Knowledge Search** | Hybrid retrieval using Weaviate (semantic embeddings) + Neo4j (graph structure). Supports LLM reranking and connected-page enrichment. |
