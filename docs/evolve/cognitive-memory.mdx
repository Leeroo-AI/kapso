<Warning>
**This module has been archived.** The Cognitive Memory system has been replaced by the simpler `ExperimentHistoryStore` which provides experiment history via MCP tools. See [Experiment Lifecycle](/evolve/experiment-lifecycle) for the current approach.

## Overview

The Cognitive Memory system was designed to enable Kapso to learn from past experiments and provide contextual briefings. It has been archived in favor of a simpler MCP-based approach.

## Current Approach: Experiment History via MCP

Instead of the complex cognitive memory system, experiment history is now:

1. **Stored** in `.kapso/experiment_history.json` (with optional Weaviate indexing)
2. **Accessed** via MCP tools during ideation:
   - `get_top_experiments(k)` - Best scoring experiments
   - `get_recent_experiments(k)` - Most recent experiments
   - `search_similar_experiments(query, k)` - Semantic search

This approach is simpler and gives the agent more control over what context to retrieve.

## Archived Components

The following components are available in `/archive/memory/`:

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `CognitiveController` | Orchestrated memory system |
| `EpisodicStore` | Stored learned insights |
| `KnowledgeRetriever` | Retrieved domain knowledge |
| `DecisionMaker` | RETRY/PIVOT/COMPLETE decisions |
| `InsightExtractor` | Extracted rules from errors |

## Migration

If you were using the cognitive memory system:

```python
# OLD: Cognitive Memory
from src.memory import CognitiveController
controller = CognitiveController(knowledge_search=kg)
briefing = controller.prepare_briefing()

# NEW: Experiment History via MCP
# The agent automatically has access to experiment history tools
# during ideation via the "experiment_history" MCP gate
```

Configure the experiment history gate in your search strategy:

```yaml
search_strategy:
  type: "generic"
  params:
    ideation_gates: ["idea", "code", "research", "experiment_history"]
```

The agent will use these tools to query past experiments as needed.
