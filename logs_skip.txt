[32m  [thinking] Let me launch parallel agents to process different batches of files. I'll start with 3 agents covering the core Python package, the EBM/glassbox module, and the utility/blackbox modules.[0m
[32m  [thinking] This is a large repository with 500 files. I can see it's the DuckDB database project. Most files are in `third_party/` (vendor dependencies), with core files in `benchmark/`, `src/`, `tools/`, `scripts/`, `test/`, and root-level config files.

Let me plan the approach. I'll use parallel sub-agents to process files in batches efficiently. The key insight is that the vast majority (350+) of files are third-party library code that can be described with brief, pattern-based descriptions.[0m

[32m  [thinking] Good, I understand the format. Now I'll launch parallel sub-agents to process files in bulk. I'll divide the 500 files into groups and process them with multiple agents.[0m
