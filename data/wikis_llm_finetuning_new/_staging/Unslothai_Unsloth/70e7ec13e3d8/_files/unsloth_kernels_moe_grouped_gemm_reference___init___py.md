## Understanding

**Status:** ✅ Explored

**Purpose:** Empty package initializer marking `reference` as a Python package containing reference MoE implementations and operation utilities.

**Mechanism:** The file is empty, serving as a namespace marker for the reference implementation subpackage which includes model-specific layers (Llama4, Qwen3) and common MoE operations.

**Significance:** Organizes reference implementations used for correctness validation and as base classes for Triton-optimized MoE layers.
