## Understanding

**Status:** Explored

**Purpose:** Placeholder/stub file reserved for future Llama 4 model support, currently contains only commented-out imports.

**Mechanism:** Contains only the Apache 2.0 license header and a commented import line: `# from unsloth_studio.models import patch_llama4`. The actual implementation is expected to come from `unsloth_studio` (likely a proprietary/premium component) when Llama 4 is released and supported.

**Significance:** Future placeholder - indicates planned support for Llama 4 architecture. The commented import suggests the implementation will be provided through unsloth_studio rather than the open-source repository, following a pattern where advanced/new features may be in a separate package.
