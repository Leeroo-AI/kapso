## Understanding

**Status:** ✅ Explored

**Purpose:** Package initialization file for reference implementations of MoE layers.

**Mechanism:** Empty __init__.py file that marks the directory as a Python package, allowing imports from the reference module.

**Significance:** Standard Python package structure file that enables the reference directory to be treated as a module. Contains no code but is necessary for organizing reference implementations used for correctness testing and benchmarking against optimized kernels.
