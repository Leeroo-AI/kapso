## Understanding

**Status:** ✅ Explored

**Purpose:** Placeholder for DPO and KTO trainer patches

**Mechanism:** Defines two functions `PatchDPOTrainer()` and `PatchKTOTrainer()` that currently just return without doing anything. These are stub functions exported in the public API.

**Significance:** Reserved for future Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) training support. The functions are exported so they can be called without breaking existing code, but actual implementations may be in unsloth_zoo or planned for future releases. This maintains API compatibility while the features are being developed.
