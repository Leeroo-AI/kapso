## Understanding

**Status:** ✅ Explored

**Purpose:** Placeholder file for future Llama 4 model support, currently containing only commented-out imports from unsloth_studio.

**Mechanism:** Contains two commented lines that would import and call patch_llama4() from unsloth_studio.models. The file is essentially empty and serves as a placeholder for future implementation when Llama 4 models are released and require specific optimizations.

**Significance:** Preparatory module indicating planned support for Llama 4 architecture. The commented code suggests that Llama 4 patches will be implemented in the unsloth_studio package when needed. Currently has no functional impact on the codebase but reserves the namespace for future development.
