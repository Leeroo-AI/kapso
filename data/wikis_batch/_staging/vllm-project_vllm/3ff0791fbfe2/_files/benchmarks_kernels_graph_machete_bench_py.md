## Understanding

**Status:** ✅ Explored

**Purpose:** Generates Machete benchmark visualization graphs

**Mechanism:** Post-processing script for Machete benchmark results. Loads pickle files generated by benchmark_machete.py, processes performance data using pandas, and creates comparison visualizations using matplotlib/seaborn. Generates graphs showing Machete performance relative to baselines (torch.matmul, Marlin, CUTLASS) across different matrix shapes, quantization types, and configurations. Supports regex filtering of benchmark results for focused analysis.

**Significance:** Visualization tool for understanding Machete kernel performance characteristics. Helps identify scenarios where Machete excels vs falls short compared to alternatives. Essential for presenting benchmark results and making informed kernel selection decisions. Enables visual analysis of performance trends across configuration space. Supports publication-quality performance graphs.
