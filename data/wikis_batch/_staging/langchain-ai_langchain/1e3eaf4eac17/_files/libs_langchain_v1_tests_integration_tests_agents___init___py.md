## Understanding

**Status:** ✅ Explored

**Purpose:** Package marker for agent integration tests.

**Mechanism:** Contains module-level docstring stating "Integration tests for the agents module." Organizes tests for agent functionality that requires external API calls.

**Significance:** Separates agent-specific integration tests from other integration tests. Agents are complex components that orchestrate LLM calls, tools, and decision-making logic requiring real model interactions.
