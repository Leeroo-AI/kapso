**Status:** ✅ Explored

**Purpose:** Package initialization file for agent middleware implementation tests, marking the directory as a Python package to enable test discovery and imports.

**Mechanism:** Empty `__init__.py` file that allows pytest to discover and run tests in the middleware implementations directory, following standard Python package conventions.

**Significance:** Standard Python package marker essential for test organization and discovery in the LangChain test suite. Enables pytest to properly identify and execute tests for middleware implementations.
