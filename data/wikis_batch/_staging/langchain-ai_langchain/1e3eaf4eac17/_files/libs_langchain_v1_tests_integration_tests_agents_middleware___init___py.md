## Understanding

**Status:** ✅ Explored

**Purpose:** Package marker for agent middleware integration tests.

**Mechanism:** Contains module-level docstring stating "Integration tests for agent middleware." Organizes tests for middleware components that extend agent functionality.

**Significance:** Middleware components (like ShellToolMiddleware) add capabilities to agents without modifying core agent logic. Requires integration testing since middleware interacts with real system resources and models.
