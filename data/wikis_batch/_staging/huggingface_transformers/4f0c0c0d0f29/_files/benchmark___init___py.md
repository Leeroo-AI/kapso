## Understanding

**Status:** ✅ Explored

**Purpose:** Package initializer for the benchmark module. This is an empty file that marks the benchmark directory as a Python package.

**Mechanism:** The file contains only a copyright header with no executable code. It serves as a package marker that allows Python to recognize the benchmark directory as an importable package, enabling relative imports and package structure.

**Significance:** This is a standard Python package convention file. While empty, it is essential for the benchmark package to be properly recognized and imported by Python's module system, allowing other files in the transformers repository to import benchmark utilities.
