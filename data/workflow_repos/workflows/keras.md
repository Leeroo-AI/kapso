=== Description ===
Keras 3 is a high-level, multi-backend deep learning framework for building and training neural networks. It supports running the same Keras workflows on top of TensorFlow, JAX, PyTorch, and OpenVINO (inference-only).

=== Usage ===
It is directly applicable to day-to-day ML workflows (model authoring, training loops, datasets integration, and inference) and is widely adopted in the ML community, making it both a production tool and a strong educational reference.
