=== Description ===
PyTorch Geometric (PyG) is a Graph Neural Network (GNN) library built on PyTorch for building, training, and scaling deep learning models on graph-structured and other irregular data. It provides a unified API with many implemented GNN architectures, minibatch loaders, dataset utilities/benchmarks, transforms, and support for large-scale and heterogeneous graphs.

=== Usage ===
It is directly applicable to ML/data workflows involving node/edge/graph prediction, supports common benchmark datasets and transforms, and includes tooling for mini-batching and scaling to large graphs.
