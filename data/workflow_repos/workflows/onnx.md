=== Description ===
Reference implementation and specification for the Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX), an open standard model format enabling interoperability across machine learning frameworks and runtimes. It defines an extensible computation graph, standard operator sets (opsets), data types, and provides tooling such as model checking, shape/type inference, and graph optimization.

=== Usage ===
It is directly applicable in ML workflows for exporting, validating, converting, optimizing, and interoperating models across frameworks and deployment targets, especially for inference.
