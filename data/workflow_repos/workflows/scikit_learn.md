=== Description ===
scikit-learn is a widely used open-source Python library for machine learning built on top of the SciPy ecosystem. It provides efficient implementations of classical ML algorithms and utilities for preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation.

=== Usage ===
It is directly applicable to everyday ML/data science work, integrates tightly with NumPy/SciPy and the broader Python data stack, and is one of the most widely adopted ML libraries in the ecosystem (as reflected by its large community and star count).
