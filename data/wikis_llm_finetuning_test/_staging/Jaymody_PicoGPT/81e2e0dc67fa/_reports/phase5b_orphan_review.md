## Coverage Verification

**Repository Source Files (4 total):**
1. `gpt2_pico.py` - Documented in `_files/gpt2_pico_py.md`
2. `gpt2.py` - Documented in `_files/gpt2_py.md`

**Result:** All source files in the Jaymody_PicoGPT repository have corresponding wiki documentation. No orphan files exist - the wiki has complete coverage of the codebase.

## Notes

- The prior phases successfully documented all source files
- No additional manual review decisions were required
