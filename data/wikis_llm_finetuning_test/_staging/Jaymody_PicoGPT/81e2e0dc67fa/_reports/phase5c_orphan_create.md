# Phase 6c: Orphan Page Creation Report

## Summary

**No orphan files required documentation.** The triage phase (6a) and review phase (6b) determined that all repository files already have adequate wiki coverage.

## Orphan Candidates Analysis

| Category | Count | Action Taken |
|----------|-------|--------------|
| AUTO_KEEP | 0 | N/A |
| AUTO_DISCARD | 0 | N/A |
| MANUAL_REVIEW | 0 | N/A |

## Repository Coverage Status

All 4 Python files in the repository are fully documented:

| File | Lines | Coverage |
|------|-------|----------|
| `encoder.py` | 120 | ✅ 2 Implementations, 2 Principles, 1 Environment |
| `gpt2.py` | 121 | ✅ 2 Implementations, 2 Principles, 1 Environment, 3 Heuristics |
| `gpt2_pico.py` | 62 | ✅ 1 Workflow |
| `utils.py` | 82 | ✅ 1 Implementation, 1 Principle, 1 Environment, 1 Heuristic |

## Pages Created

### Implementations
| Page | Source File | Lines |
|------|-------------|-------|
| — | (none) | — |

### Principles
| Page | Implemented By |
|------|----------------|
| — | (none) |

## Statistics

- Implementation pages created: **0**
- Principle pages created: **0**
- Files linked to existing Principles: **0**

## Coverage Updates

- RepoMap entries updated: **0** (no changes needed)
- Index entries added: **0** (no changes needed)

## Notes for Orphan Audit Phase

- No orphan pages were created in this phase
- All repository files have existing wiki coverage from prior phases
- The small repository size (4 Python files, 385 total lines) allowed complete coverage during initial excavation

## Completion Status

| Criterion | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| ALL AUTO_KEEP files have `✅ DONE` status | ✅ (N/A - no files) |
| ALL APPROVED MANUAL_REVIEW files have wiki pages | ✅ (N/A - no files) |
| RepoMap Coverage column updated | ✅ (no updates needed) |
| Page indexes updated | ✅ (no updates needed) |
