## Decision Guide for Agent

For MANUAL_REVIEW files, evaluate:

1. **Does it have a public API?** (class or function without `_` prefix)
2. **Is it user-facing?** (would a user import/call this?)
3. **Does it implement a distinct algorithm?** (not just glue code)

Write decision as:
- `✅ APPROVED` — Create wiki page
- `❌ REJECTED` — Skip (with reasoning)
