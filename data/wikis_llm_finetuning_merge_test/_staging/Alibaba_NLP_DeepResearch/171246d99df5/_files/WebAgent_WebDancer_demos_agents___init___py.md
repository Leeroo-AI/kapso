## Understanding

**Status:** ✅ Explored

**Purpose:** Package initialization file that marks the `agents` directory as a Python package.

**Mechanism:** Contains only a coding declaration (`# coding=utf-8`). Acts as an empty package marker that allows Python imports from the agents submodule.

**Significance:** Structural utility file enabling the modular organization of agent classes like SearchAgent. Required for Python to recognize the directory as an importable package.
