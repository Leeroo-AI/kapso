## Understanding

**Status:** ✅ Explored

**Purpose:** Placeholder/stub file for the search tool implementation in NestBrowse.

**Mechanism:** The file contains only a comment directing users to obtain the search tool configuration from the "Inference" folder in the "DeepResearch" repository. No actual implementation is present in this file.

**Significance:** Acts as a reference pointer indicating that the Search tool class (used in `infer_async_nestbrowse.py`) is implemented elsewhere in the DeepResearch codebase, specifically in the Inference folder. The actual search functionality would provide web search capabilities similar to other DeepResearch agents.
