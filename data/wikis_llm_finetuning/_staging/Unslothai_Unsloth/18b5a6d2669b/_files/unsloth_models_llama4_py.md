## Understanding

**Status:** ✅ Explored

**Purpose:** Placeholder stub for future LLaMA 4 model support. Currently contains only commented-out import statement for unsloth_studio patch.

**Mechanism:** Contains 3 lines of commented code that would import and call patch_llama4() from unsloth_studio.models. No active implementation. The file exists but does nothing when imported.

**Significance:** Reserved namespace for Meta's LLaMA 4 when released. Indicates Unsloth's forward-looking architecture - create file structure before models exist. The unsloth_studio reference suggests LLaMA 4 support may be in a separate proprietary module. At 16 lines (mostly copyright header), this is the smallest model file and serves as documentation of intended support rather than actual implementation.
