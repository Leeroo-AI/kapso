## Understanding

**Status:** ✅ Explored

**Purpose:** Marks the agents integration tests directory as a Python package.

**Mechanism:** Contains only a module docstring ("Integration tests for the agents module.") to identify the test scope.

**Significance:** Organizes integration tests for agent functionality that requires external API calls, separate from unit tests that can run in isolation.
