## Understanding

**Status:** ✅ Explored

**Purpose:** Marks the unit_tests directory as a Python package for test discovery.

**Mechanism:** This is an empty `__init__.py` file that enables Python to recognize the directory as a package, allowing pytest and other test runners to discover and import test modules within the unit_tests directory hierarchy.

**Significance:** Standard Python package marker required for pytest to properly discover and organize unit tests within the monorepo structure.
