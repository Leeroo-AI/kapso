## Understanding

**Status:** ✅ Explored

**Purpose:** Marks the agent middleware integration tests directory as a Python package.

**Mechanism:** Contains only a module docstring ("Integration tests for agent middleware.") to identify the test scope.

**Significance:** Organizes integration tests specifically for agent middleware components that require external services or APIs, enabling focused testing of middleware behavior in real-world scenarios.
