## Understanding

**Status:** ✅ Explored

**Purpose:** Marks the agents test directory as a Python package for test discovery.

**Mechanism:** This is an empty `__init__.py` file that enables Python to recognize the agents directory as a package, allowing pytest to discover and import agent-related test modules and shared testing utilities.

**Significance:** Standard Python package marker that enables modular organization of agent unit tests and shared test fixtures within the testing hierarchy.
