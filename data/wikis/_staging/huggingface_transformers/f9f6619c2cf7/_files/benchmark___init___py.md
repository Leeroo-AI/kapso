## Understanding

**Status:** ✅ Explored

**Purpose:** Package initializer for the benchmark module. This file is empty and serves only to mark the `benchmark` directory as a Python package.

**Mechanism:** Empty `__init__.py` file that allows Python to recognize the `benchmark` directory as an importable package, enabling relative imports between benchmark module files.

**Significance:** Standard Python package structure file with no functional code, required for the benchmark module to be properly organized as a package in the transformers repository.
