## Understanding

**Status:** ✅ Explored

**Purpose:** Empty initialization file marking tests directory as Python package.

**Mechanism:** Contains no code, serving only as a package marker. The file exists but has no lines of code - it's an empty `__init__.py` file that enables Python to treat the tests directory as an importable package.

**Significance:** Standard Python convention for package structure. Allows test modules to be imported and discovered by test runners. Essential for organizing tests as a proper Python package hierarchy.
